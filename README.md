### Runnign The Script 
We first need to make the shell script into an executable. After Downloaidng the git repo,
`cd` into the moching_sponge dir and locate the moch.sh file. Then run the command `chmod +x moch.sh`. This will make the moch.sh file into an executable.
Now to run the script simply ```./moch.sh``` and enter the string you want to moch when prompted for input.
